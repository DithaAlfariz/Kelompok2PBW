The `vendor` directory is automatically generated by Composer when you install dependencies. Therefore, it does not contain any specific files or contents that you need to manually create. 

To set up the `vendor` directory, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory (`lapor`).
2. Run `composer install` after you have created your `composer.json` file and added your required packages. This command will create the `vendor` directory and install all the dependencies listed in your `composer.json`.

Once you run `composer install`, the `vendor` directory will be populated with the necessary files and dependencies.
